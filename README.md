# hackstreetboys

hackstreetboys aka [hsb] is a CTF team from the Philippines.

The team was created with the high ambition of being the country's premier CTF team.

We are a group of professionals with huge interest in various areas of cybersecurity, as well as playing CTFs. You can check our recently participated events and rankings on [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/team/43377) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/teams/profile/1246).

We aim to be an organization that encourages knowledge-sharing — a place where all the members can gain direct mentorship from each other through joint discussions and continuous participation. 

We aim to be a close-knit group that may, (hopefully) one day, regularly put the Philippines in the international CTF world map. 

We hope that through this group, we may be able to share our knowledge to fellow countrymen — especially the younger generations — so that someday, they may carry the same ambition and goals that we had when we formed this team.
